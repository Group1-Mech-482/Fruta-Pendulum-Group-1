### Introduction 
<br/>
For our project, our group has designed an interactive rotating cat toy. This cat toy consists of a Furuta pendulum, which is an inverted pendulum that pivots around the end of a driven arm. The driven arm rotates in the horizontal plane, as well as the pendulum attached via the arm which allows for rotation along the vertical plane. Since the Furuta pendulum is an unstable system, there must be feedback to give the user a signal that determines whether the task at hand has succeeded or failed. Throughout this document, the experiment setup of the rotating cat toy can be seen in detail as well as included graphical data analysis description.
