### Introduction 

For our project, our group has designed an interactive rotating cat toy. This cat toy consists of a Furuta pendulum, which is an inverted pendulum that pivots around the end of a driven arm. The driven arm rotates in the horizontal plane, as well as the pendulum attached via the arm which allows for rotation along the vertical plane.
