### Introduction 

For our project, our group has designed an interactive rotating cat toy. This cat toy consists of a Furuta pendulum, which is an inverted pendulum that pivots around the end of a driven arm. The driven arm rotates in the horizontal plane, as well as the pendulum attached via the arm which allows for rotation along the vertical plane. The device will have protective covers to insure user safety.
